Creating a discordBot with James

There are a few steps that need to be taken outside the code.
1: You need to make sure you are an admin on the Discord server you want your bot to live on.
2: Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and click "New Application"
3: Name your bot something that is helpful and generate your token.  This will be needed for authenticating the bot.
4: On the bot's page, click the slides for Presence Intent and Server Members Intent, locked under Privileged Gatreway Intents
